#Review functions, objects and arrays

* In computer programming, a **function** or subroutine is a sequence of program instructions that perform a specific task, packaged as a unit. This unit can then be used in programs wherever that particular task should be performed. Subprograms may be defined within programs, or separately in libraries that can be used by multiple programs. In different programming languages, a subroutine may be called a procedure, a function, a routine, a method, or a subprogram.
* a software **object** is a collection of related variables and functions. In the context of objects, a variable is called a field (or instance variable) and function is called a method. An object combines related data (fields) with related actions or behaviors (methods). Examples: PImage, PFont
* a **class** is a specification for an object. It's the cookie cutter to build individual objects.
*  The **constructor** always has the same name as the class. The purpose of the constructor is to assign the initial values to the fields when an object (an instance of the class) is created. The code inside the constructor block is run once when the object is first created.
*  use a new tab for each new class in your program. A new .pde file will be created for each tab in your sketch folder.
*  reminder that counting in Processing begins at 0 so that first element of a list is at the 0 index

#P5JS

* What is it?

##Definitions

* P5js is a JavaScript library
* JavaScript - a programming language used as part of web browsing. Allows scripts to interact with user, control browser, communicate asynchronously, alter document contents.
* library - a collection of resources used to develop software. Designed for re-use. Extends functionality of a language. Can be used by multiple programs that have no relation to each other.

##Differences from Processing

* Processing is a language and integrated development environment. Built on Java. Technically it's a "class." Synchronous.
