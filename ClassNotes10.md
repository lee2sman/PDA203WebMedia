#Review drawing with code sketches by students

* Students load up on computer. Walk around and check them out.

#Watch How To Draw With Code - Casey Reas

#Variables And Datatypes

###Definitions

* Character (char)
* String
* Integer

###Debug with PrintLn()


# Conditionals and Loops

* Assigning Value vs Testing Values ```=``` vs ```==```
* [Program Flow](http://cdn.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/while.jpeg?bd76e7)
* If - "IF a is true, then do this" ELSE "do this"
* For - "Repeat until"
* [Example If program](https://www.processing.org/reference/if.html)

````
//basic use of For and If
for (int i = 5; i < height; i += 5) {
  stroke(255);   // Set the color to white
  if (i < 35) {  // When 'i' is less than 35...
    stroke(0);   //...set the color to black
  }
  line(30, i, 80, i);
}

* [Example Else program](https://www.processing.org/reference/else.html)
* Looping inside draw() function of Processing
* also: && and || (or)

# Functions

* A group of code that is named for easy retrieval/re-use
* There are many built-in functions such as ```mouseDragged()```
* A function's input is called its **paramenters**
* It's output is a **return**

#Early Algorithmic Art

* Vera Molnar 

"Algorist" is a term used for digital artists who create algorithmic art. Jean-Pierre Hebert:

```
if (creation && object of art && algorithm && one's own algorithm) {
     include * an algorist *
} elseif (!creation || !object of art || !algorithm || !one's own algorithm) {
     exclude * not an algorist *
}
```

#Reading

* Getting Started With Processing through Chapter 6
