#Working With Images

* JPEGs are typically used for images such as photographs.
* uses a mathematical algorithm to compress the image and will distort the original slightly. The lower the compression, the higher the file size, but the clearer the image.
* GIFs are typically used for images with solid colors, such as icons or logos
* can have no more than 256 colors, but they maintain the colors of the original image. The lower the number of colors you have in the image, the lower the file size will be. GIFs also allow any pixel in the image to be transparent
* PNGs. mostly replaced gifs. replicates colors, much like a GIF, but allows 16 million colors as well as alpha transparency (that is, an area could be 50% transparent).
