#Intro to Programming

* What is computational media? What is programming? What is it good for? What kinds of programming languages are there?
* **Computational media** - computer as medium. 
* **Creative Coding** - Creative coding is a type of computer programming in which the goal is to create something expressive instead of something functional. It is used to create live visuals and for VJing, as well as creating visual art and design, art installations, projections and projection mapping, sound art, advertising, product prototypes, and much more. from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_coding)

#Some websites to look at

* [Chrome Experiments](http://www.chromeexperiments.com/)
* [Creative Applications](creativeapplications.net)

#What is Processing?

* What is Processing? Why Processing and P5.JS?

#Intro programming terms

**block** - A list of code statements enclosed within braces, the { and } characters.

**coordinate system**  - A system of numbers that define the location of positions on screen. The Processing coordinate system uses the upper-left corner as the origin (0,0) with the x-coordinates increasing to the right and y-coordintes increasing down the screen. Positions within the coordinate system are defined in units of pixels. For example, (100, 20) is 100 pixels from the uppper-left corner of the display window and 20 pixels to the right.

**true** - The opposite of 'false', which means an expression has evaluated to true. For example, 5 > 1 is true.

**false** - The opposite of 'true', which means an expression has evaluated to false. For example, 1 > 5 is false.

**function** - A program element with a specific purpose, a function often has parameters to define its behavior. For example, the rect() function draws a rectangle to the screen. The parameters placed within the function's parentheses define the location and dimensions of the shape. In other programming tutorials, functions are sometimes called methods, subroutines, commands, or procedures.

**relational expression** - A code expression that compares two values with a relational operator. For example, greater than (>) or less than (<).

**variable** - A container to store data that has a name and value. For example, the mouseX variable will have a value of 200 when the cursor is 200 pixels from the left edge of the display window.

#Drawing With Numbers

* Coordinate system
* Processing's drawing and color functions   
* rect() and rectMode() demo    
* ellipse() and ellipseMode() demo    
* fill() greyscale and color demo    
* stroke() and noStroke()
* mouseX() and mouseY()

#Where to go for help?

* [Reference](https://processing.org/reference/)
* [Processing Forum](forum.processing.org)
* [Google](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=processing%20p5%20how%20to%20create%20a%20button) - it may help to add p5 since Processing is a generic coding word
* [Example programs](https://processing.org/examples/)
