#Final Project

There are two parts to the final assignment. The first part of the assignment is the creation of a final web artwork due April 30. The second part is the creation of an online portfolio presenting all works from throughout the semester, due during finals week.

This semester we reviewed a history of internet art as well as HTML, Processing and the Javascript library P5.JS as a means to explore interdisciplinary web-based media.

In class and assignments we explored interactivity and the web, hypermedia, time and motion-based work, digital sketching, and algorithmic art generation. We looked at many different web art projects by dozens of artists, past and present.

The final project should be a creative project that is inspired by this history and concepts and skills we covered this semester. Students should design a project based on their own interest and develop it from concept to completion.

The final web media project is intended to be presented to an in-person and online audience. **It must be a well-conceived, properly-executed web media project, including informational text or instructions, elements of interaction, and the use of media to further your conceptual idea.** 

You will be graded on the strength of your concept as well as the technical mastery of your design, code, and media. Students are encouraged to pick a topic or concept of personal interest and to explore it with an experimental web-media approach. 

For their online portfolio, students can take a variety of approaches: via html and css, javascript or other means. The web portfolio should be hosted at a specific web URL, with links to all web media projects the student made this semester.

#Review inspirational web art projects as a class

#Review student final project ideas

* Students break into pairs to present their ideas, concept, sketches and to ask questions.
* Students should critique their partner's idea and discuss what they find compelling and what parts need to be rethought
* Students explain partner's project idea to the rest of the group and get feedback.
