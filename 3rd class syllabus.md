#Review Some Notes On New Expressions-Jacob Ciocci

Article [here](http://hyperallergic.com/170279/some-notes-on-new-expressions-by-jacob-ciocci/) 

Jacob's notes to discuss

1.  Think Outside The Box - meant several ways including thinking about each design program's (KidPix, Photoshop, NewHive) artmaking interface. icons (looks like pencils, pens, erasers, etc). 
> After watching the site for about six months, I started thinking about how the design and interactivity on NewHive communicated certain biases and beliefs, and how that affects the kind of work that’s created on the site. (Of course, even the most open platforms have biases — and it’s these biases, along with the ideology expressed through marketing language, that I often use as raw material when working with any new tool or interface.-Jacob Ciocci

2.  The Big Box - inspiration from craft stores (Michaels, Jo Anne Fabrics). Paint by Numbers, branding on paint, etc. Biases impact how these tools are used.

3.  Rules Set You Free - creating your own rules/structure. Sol Lewitt. John Cage, etc.

4.  New Expressions (Tumblr, MySpace, NewHive, Pinterest)as 21st century crafting culture

5.  Layering

6.  Making Media Easy - internet art culture as one of reconfiguring past work

7.  All art as being "painting by numbers". Following your own systems.


#Discussion about critiquing art

* Each student discusses one NewHive site they picked and why they like/dislike it

A framework (ideas/descriptions adapted from [How To Critique Art - Diversified Arts](https://diversifiedarts.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/artistic-criticism-how-to-critique-art/) )

1.  DESCRIPTION - Talk about the subject matter and the medium that was used to create the work.
2.  ANALYSIS - Using your background, knowledge of art history and principles of design to analyze an artwork's formal qualities
3.  INTERPRETATION - Share your own ideas about what you think the artist was trying to express. What does this work mean? What idea does this work represent? Compare and contrast to other pieces you know about.
4.  JUDGEMENT - The most subjective section. Expressing your own thoughts on the work with an aesthetic and conceptual response. Explanation based on your description, analyis and interpretation.

Another framework:
**What was the artist trying to say? Did they say it? Do I think it was worth saying?**

###Description
What do you visually and literally see?

* who is the artist?
* what is the medium?
* how was it made?
* when is it from? 
* What objects are in the piece? How is it presented (video, website)
* Color in the work.
* Shapes
* Texture
* Lines
* Visual mood/effect

###Analysis
Separate the parts or elements of the work. Think about texture, shape and form, light/dark or bright/dull colors, types of lines, and sensory qualities. Consider the most significant art principles that were used in the artwork. Describe how the artist used them to organize the elements.

* How has the artist used colors in the work(s)?
* What sort of effect do the colors have on the artwork?
* How has the artist used shapes within the work of art?
* How have lines been used in the work(s)?
* Has the artist used them as an important or dominant part of the work, or do they play a different roll?
* What role does texture play in the work(s)? Has the artist used the illusion of texture or has the artist used actual texture? How has texture been used within the work(s).
* How has the artist used light in the work(s)? Is there the illusion of a scene with lights and shadows, or does the artist use light and dark values in a more abstracted way?
* How has the overall visual effect or mood of the work(s)? been achieved by the use of elements of art and principles of design.
* How were the artists design tools used to achieve a particular look or focus? 

###Interpretation
Explain the work based on what you have seen and understood about the work. What was the artist trying to say?

* What was the artist’s statement in this work?
* What do you think it means?
* What does it mean to you?
* How does this relate to you and your life?
* What feelings do you have when looking at this artwork?
* Do you think there are things in the artwork that represent other things/symbols?
* Why do you think that the artist chose to work in this manner and made these kinds of artistic decisions?
* Why did the artist create this artwork?

###Judgement
After careful observation, analysis, and interpretation of an artwork, you are ready to make your own judgment. This is your personal evaluation based on the understandings of the work(s).

* Why do you think this work has intrinsic value or worth? What is the value you find in the work(s)? (For example, is it a beautiful work of art, does it convey an important social message, affects the way that I see the world, makes insightful connections, reaffirms a religious belief, etc.)
* Do you think that the work(s) has a benefit for others?
* Do you find that the work communicates an idea, feeling or principle that would have value for others?
* Could the reason you find the work lacking come from a poor use of the elements of art? Explain.
* Is the subject matter unappealing, unimaginative, or repulsive? How?
* What kind of an effect do you think the work could have for others?
* Rather than seeing the work as being very effective or without total value, does the work fall somewhere in-between? Do you think that the work is just o.k.? What do you base this opinion on? The use of elements of art? Lack of personal expression? The work lacks a major focus? Explore your criticism of the work (s) as much as you would any positive perceptions. Realize that your own tastes and prejudices may enter into your criticism. Give your positive and negative perceptions.
