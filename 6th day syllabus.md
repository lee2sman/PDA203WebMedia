* Apply ideas from the Tufte reading to "escape flatland".
* Can include formal photography, candid snapshots, video, etc
* May include text or not

#Students work on Webify project

* Example site [Memory Extender](http://104.236.48.182:3002/netmedia01/memex1.html)
* Experiment with simplicity and constraints. Use the technical parts we've learned so far to create something contemplative or unique or unusual. Your site can be as abstract and experimental as you like or can be styled more like a standard website. The only technical requirements is that it must contain at least one link, at least one image, and use CSS styling.
