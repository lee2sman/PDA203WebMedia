**Digital Art**
Digital art is an artistic work or practice that uses digital technology as an essential part of the creative or presentation process. Under the larger umbrella term new media art.

Examples: art game, computer art, computer music, generative art, generative music, software art, interactive art, cyber art

**Algorithmic Art**
the design is generated by an algorithm.
an algorithm is simply a detailed recipe for the design and possibly execution of an artwork, which may include computer code, functions, expressions, or other input which ultimately determines the form the art will take. This input may be mathematical, computational, or generative in nature. 

**Hypermedia**    
an extension of the term hypertext, is a nonlinear medium of information which includes graphics, audio, video, plain text and hyperlinks.

**New Media**
Most technologies described as new media are digital, often having characteristics of being manipulated, networkable, dense, compressible, and interactive. Some examples may be the Internet, websites, computer multimedia, video games, augmented reality, CD-ROMS, and DVDs.

#The Medium Is The Message

Marshall McLuhan's now famous declaration in Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man (1964) that "the medium is the message" drew attention to the too often ignored influence media and technology themselves, rather than their "content," have on humans' experience of the world and on society broadly.
