#Review: What is web media? 

**Digital Art**
Digital art is an artistic work or practice that uses digital technology as an essential part of the creative or presentation process. Under the larger umbrella term new media art.

Examples: art game, computer art, computer music, generative art, generative music, software art, interactive art, cyber art

**Algorithmic Art**
the design is generated by an algorithm.
an algorithm is simply a detailed recipe for the design and possibly execution of an artwork, which may include computer code, functions, expressions, or other input which ultimately determines the form the art will take. This input may be mathematical, computational, or generative in nature. 

**Hypermedia**    
an extension of the term hypertext, is a nonlinear medium of information which includes graphics, audio, video, plain text and hyperlinks.

**New Media**
Most technologies described as new media are digital, often having characteristics of being manipulated, networkable, dense, compressible, and interactive. Some examples may be the Internet, websites, computer multimedia, video games, augmented reality, CD-ROMS, and DVDs.

#Reading Review

#The Medium Is The Message 
Marshall McLuhan's now famous declaration in Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man (1964) that "the medium is the message" drew attention to the too often ignored influence media and technology themselves, rather than their "content," have on humans' experience of the world and on society broadly.

**do we agree with marshall's statement? is he right that medium is more important than message? is that still true or only true in his time?**

#Lev Manovich

8 defining principles

#The Vernacular Web
*  Geocities     
*  **can great art happen with these tools or just amateur work?**
*  Tumblr/Moving gifs/Vine    
*  YouTube/Vimeo    
*  NewHive   

#Discussion of Marshall McLuhan in regards to web 2.0
*At the same time, I'm skeptical of its claim to be a "blank canvas," which obfuscates the aesthetic and political assumptions that it—that any cultural interface—reproduces.*

*  Discussion about distribution - the web's ability to distribute/spread info/art
*  Limitations of its ability
*  what community/ies does it serve?
*  what can web art and web platforms be? play and experimentation. Newhives have functioned as visual diaries and written diaries. There have been essays, music videos, a songbook, collages, a compilation of physics information. There are also a number of universities that use it for class projects.
